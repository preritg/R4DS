# R4DS
Contains follow along exercises from R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

There are three primary objectives for creating this repository:
1. Understand DS workflow in R
2. Make the code as readable and reusable as possible
3. Add generous amounts of comments to explain what is happening in the code
